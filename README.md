# Design-Commmunity-objectives
Service design and Interaction design community objectives planning and progress

1. There are 4 design imperatives which contain high level epics.
2. Epics are long term goals we're looking to achieve over a period of 1 to 2 years. We'll set quartly objectives to help us achieve and deliver against our goals. 
3. Quartly objectives are shared with the community to lead or contribute. Our small working groups means we can deliver within our delivery teams but also mature our profession in the areas which interest our designers. This gives us added benefits such as connecting and getting to know other professionals who you wouldn't always work with. 
4. Designers can work with like minded people within their profession / family or wider during profession time to help their own delivery team and wider. 
5. Profession time is deadicated time every Thursday from 1-4pm weekly.
